"1":"getting started Getting started getting started Hitachi Storage Advisor is a unified software management tool that reduces the complexity of managing storage systems by simplifying the setup, management, and maintenance of storage resources. Get Started with Hitachi Infrastructure Director This video provides guidance to configure a storage system by providing a step-by-step workflow instruction with guided steps and UI transitions explaining each step. You can review the following to gain an understanding of Storage Advisor concepts: © 2015, 2016 Hitachi Ltd. All rights reserved.",
"2":"overview of 	 storage advisor Overview of Storage Advisor overview Hitachi Storage Advisor Storage Advisor reduces infrastructure management complexities and enables a new simplified approach to managing storage infrastructures. It provides intuitive graphical user interfaces and recommended configuration practices to streamline system configurations and storage management operations. You can leverage Storage Advisor to easily provision new storage capacity for business applications without requiring in-depth knowledge of the underlying infrastructure resource details. It provides centralized management while reducing the number of steps to configure, optimize, and deploy new infrastructure resources. Some of the key Storage Advisor capabilities include: Simplified user experience for managing infrastructure resources. Provides visual aids to easily view and interpret key management information, such as used and available capacity, and guide features to help quickly determine appropriate next steps for a given management task. Recommended system configurations to speed initial storage system setup and accelerate new infrastructure resource deployments. Integrated configuration workflows with Hitachi recommended practices to streamline storage provisioning and data protection tasks. Common, centralized management for supported storage systems. A REST-based API to provide full management programmability and control in addition to unified file-based management support. Storage Advisor enables automated SAN zoning during volume attach and detach. Optional auto-zoning eliminates the need for repetitive zoning tasks to be performed on the switch.",
"3":"configuring block storage and file storage Configuring block storage and file storage block storage systems configuring file storage systems configuring Storage Advisor can be used to configure both block storage systems and file storage systems. Block storage systems: In a block storage system, you create storage volumes. A server-based operating system can connect to each block of storage and control it as an individual hard drive. Each storage block can be individually formatted with the required file system, such as NTFS or VMFS. Block storage systems are typically deployed in a Storage Area Network (SAN) environment. From the dashboard of Storage Advisor , you can discover, register, and onboard a block storage system. File storage systems: A file storage system is a centralized location for storing files and folders, and it is usually deployed on a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device. File storage systems use protocols such as SMB CIFS (for Windows) and NFS (for Linux and VMware). If a storage array includes block storage and optional NAS modules, the file storage is automatically added with the block storage. Then file pools and other file resources can be created in the Storage Advisor interface or by using the API.",
"4":"dashboard Dashboard dashboard password local, changing Settings menu Once a storage system has been onboarded to Storage Advisor , the dashboard displays as soon as you log in. The Storage Advisor dashboard provides the tools to easily configure, manage, and monitor storage systems. From the Storage Advisor dashboard, you can access managed resources and provision storage in the context of a given storage system or server. The provided templates and configurations make it possible to quickly and easily provision a storage system, without knowing the details of the underlying hardware and software. The top navigation menu provides access to Jobs and Monitoring pages. Links to the following Settings are available, based on the user role: Tier Management Security Settings SNMP Settings Change Local Password The dashboard has three distinct sections: Resource side panel The left pane provides quick access to review the configuration of your storage systems, servers, and fabric switches. Alert tiles At the top of the page are four alert tiles that represent various aspects of the health of your storage system. When Storage Advisor detects a problem with a storage system environment, a number appears in the tile. The number indicates the number of alerts for that aspect of the storage system. Click the alert tile to go directly to a summary of the problems. Resource summary The middle area, with the information gauge, provides a summary of the capacity allocated from the registered storage systems. Resource side panel The resource side panel enables quick access to storage systems and to servers. Click Storage Systems to view and add storage systems. Click Servers to view and add servers. Click Fabric Switches to view and add fabric switches. Alert tiles Across the top of the dashboard are tiles that display alerts for storage capacity, data protection, jobs, and hardware. If a tile includes a circled check mark, there are no alerts for that part of the storage system, and everything is functioning normally. A number in a red circle within a tile indicates one or more problems with that part of the storage system. You can click a tile for Capacity Alerts, Data Protection Alerts, or Hardware Alerts to view the summary for the category in the Monitoring tab. The Jobs Alert tile displays the number of jobs in the last 24 hours with a status of Failed or Success with Errors . Resource summary The three rings in the center of the dashboard form the information gauge, which shows information about the available storage. The numerical data for each capacity parameter in the ring is displayed to the left of the information gauge. The number in the center of the rings shows the total usable capacity of all storage systems. The total usable capacity is the capacity available from all the parity groups across all storage systems. If you do not have any parity groups configured on the storage system, this number is zero and all other data points in the capacity visualization are zero. The white, middle ring indicates the sum of all pool capacity available across all storage systems. The light grey indicates the parity group capacity that is not yet allocated to pools. If you do not have any pools created, the white ring indicates zero. As you create pools, this number increases to eventually become equal to the total usable capacity when you have consumed all parity groups for pool creation. The black, outer ring indicates the subscribed capacity, which is the sum of all volumes created on storage pools. As you start creating volumes on storage pools, the subscription starts to increase. If volume allocation results in oversubscription, a thick line extends out to the right from the top of the ring. This extended line is a key visual indicator that helps track allocation oversubscription. The green, inner ring indicates the storage utilization. As you create volumes on the pools and start consuming capacity, the utilization of thin pools increases and you will notice the value in green starting to increase. If the Thin Used (light green ring) starts to increase and get closer to your total pool capacity, that indicates that the pools may be starting to fill up. If you notice the total pool capacity (white) and Thin used (light green) values getting closer to total capacity, you may be running out of storage on one or more storage systems and may need to add disks to increase storage capacity. Review the information gauge for each storage system to identify which storage system needs additional capacity. The right side of the resource summary is the breakdown of data protection metrics. It includes a representation of types of protected, unprotected, and secondary capacity and gauge of the total percentage of capacity protected.",
"5":"analyzing data in the dashboard Analyzing data in the dashboard dashboard analyzing data The dashboard is a visual display of the important information needed to analyze the overall capacity utilization and health of your storage system. It provides visual indicators such as total usable capacity, current utilization, data protection summary, and monitoring alerts. Analyzing data shown in alert tiles The alert tiles collectively present the health of the storage system environment. In one glance you can verify that the overall health is sound if you see no alerts on the alert tiles. This means that there are no capacity or hardware issues in the environment, no failed jobs in the last 24 hours and that the data protection is working without any issues. If there are any alerts, you can drill down to the relevant alert page to investigate the cause. Storage Advisor provides alerts for capacity utilization, hardware, data protection, and jobs status. Analyzing data in the information gauge The information gauge provides a visual indication of the total capacity of all storage systems managed by Storage Advisor . The capacity indicated in the center of the ring is the total usable capacity available via the configured parity groups. After you add a storage system and configure parity groups, the total capacity indicator will show the capacity from the newly added storage system. The Thin Used capacity (green ring) indicates the total capacity that is currently being used. If the usage is around 70-80% of the total capacity, you may receive capacity alerts based on the thresholds set by your storage administrator. The white ring that provides a sum of capacities of all pools in the systems should be closer to 100% capacity. This would mean that you are using your entire party group capacity by allocating it to pools. If the Thin Used capacity in green ring nears the total capacity (white ring) then you may run out of pool capacity soon. In such a case, expand the pool to consume more capacity. If you notice that the total pool capacity (white) and Thin used (light green) values are getting closer to total capacity, you may be running out of disk capacity on one or more storage systems and would need to add disk space to increase storage capacity. Review the information gauge for each storage system to identify which storage system needs additional capacity. The information gauge below is a good indicator of capacity oversubscription. Capacity subscription beyond the total available capacity should not be an issue if your capacity utilization is well within the total capacity. Analyzing data protection metrics The balance of your protected primary volumes and secondary volumes depends on the number of copies you have chosen to maintain, and also on the type of the data protection technology being used. If you choose to set aside more volumes for data protection, then the overall usable capacity may be affected. On the other hand, if you have a large amount of unprotected data, you may want to consider data protection options.",
"6":"inventory and resource information Inventory and resource information resources inventory The inventory pages display details about the storage system resources in Storage Advisor . These resources include storage systems, servers, ports, and pools, volumes, parity groups, as well as file pools, virtual file servers, file systems, shares and exports. Common actions can be performed on the inventory pages, such as the following: You can select one or more resource and delete it. When you delete a storage system, you disassociate it from Storage Advisor . When you delete a pool or volume, the resource is de-provisioned and removed from the storage system. When a parity group is deleted, it is removed from the storage system and the disks used to create parity group are no longer in use. You can delete the parity group if you want to reconfigure the storage system with some other RAID configuration or simply decommission the array. If the parity group is in use by a pool, the parity group deletion will fail. You can click a particular resource to see more details about it on its resource detail page. When you delete a block pool, the parity groups used by the pool will no longer be in In Use status. The pool volumes on these parity groups will be formatted and the parity group will eventually be in Available status. When you delete a volume, the pool subscription will go down. Volume deletion will fail if the volume participates in data protection or is attached to a server. When you delete a file pool, it deletes the underlying block pool. When you delete a server, the server is disassociated from Storage Advisor . You will no longer be able to provision volumes to the server (or its WWNs). Server deletion will fail if it has volumes attached to it.",

Creating parity groups converts the raw disk capacity in your storage system into usable capacity. parity group creating Storage Advisor parity group concepts Storage Advisor provides a simple one-click method of parity group creation that is based on best practices applicable to the disks in the storage system. An advanced method of parity group creation is also available. You can choose to use the advanced method if there is not a need to rely on best practices. Creating parity groups in Storage Advisor also creates LDEVs that can be consumed for pool creation. Normal practice is to use all available disk capacity when creating parity groups to ensure that all of the storage system capacity is usable. There can be exceptions to this practice; for example: If the entire capacity of the storage system is not needed. If there is a need to create fewer parity groups in order to reserve more disks as spares. Viewing parity groups Access the Parity Groups page by clicking Storage Systems on the dashboard and then clicking a storage system tile. Click the Parity Groups tile.

This method creates a full copy of a primary volume at that point in time and automatically suspends the copy operation. Any further R W operations on the primary volume will not be updated to secondary volumes. The Snapshot method takes incremental snapshots of volumes based on a user-created schedule. The maximum number of snapshots is 1024. When a user offboards a storage system and onboards it again, all the protected volumes using Clone Now will remain untouched, but any Snapshot schedules will be suspended.

This option is not required to monitor hardware in Hitachi Storage Advisor . SNMP manager adding SNMP alerts enabling When an SNMP manager is added, it collects information from SNMP agents that are installed in components of registered storage systems. The storage systems send traps to Storage Advisor using SNMP v1. Storage Advisor manages such alerts automatically, for processors, memory, disks, power supplies, batteries, ports, caches, pools, and fans. Storage Advisor uses SNMP v2c to send traps to external management software as soon as they are received. The structure of the traps is defined in a MIB file and Storage Advisor uses its own MIB file to add information to traps received so that the trap is easier to understand. It is important to import the Storage Advisor file to access the additional information. The Storage Advisor MIB file is included in the product installation media. The SNMP manager enables you to do the following in the external software: Determine whether there are any problems with storage system components or whether the status is normal. Identify the specific component that in warning or critical status. The following types of components can be monitored: Processor Memory Power supply Battery Fan Physical drive or disk Port Cache Pool SNMP management requires: External management software capable of receiving SNMP alerts.

For each RAID option, it shows how many parity groups can be created and the usable capacity that will be available. It also identifies the recommended RAID configuration for every disk type and the number of spare disk that must be assigned based on best practices. Additionally, this API returns the number of total disk for a given disk type that are available and how many spare disks are already allocated.

"115":"api  	 creating parity group template [API] Creating parity group template Based on best practices, you can configure parity groups for new disks in a storage system. You can specify the RAID configuration and the number of parity groups to be created for each disk type in the storage system. parity groups creating template templates creating parity groups creating parity group template This API does the following: Based on the total number of disks of each disk type, it identifies the number of spare disks to be reserved and the number of spare disks to be allocated. Creates the required number of parity groups. If the RAID level and layout are not specified, Storage Advisor creates the pool volumes and formats the pool volumes for each parity group. Configuring parity groups with this API allows you to use a template that is based on the following best practices: Best practice 1, Hot spare disk Storage Advisor determines the ratio of hot spare disks per disk type and the selection of hot spare disks from the following supported types: Disk type Hot spare ratio SSD 1 per 32 FMD 1 per 24 FMD DC2 1 per 24 SAS 1 per 32 Best practice 2, RAID configuration and layout Storage Advisor provides a recommended RAID configuration and the number of disks per disk type and model based on the following information: Disk type and speed RAID and layout SSD, FMD, FMC RAID 6: 6D+2 SAS 15K, SAS 10K RAID 6: 6D + 2 SAS 7.2K RAID 6; 14D+2 Best practice 3, Disk selection Disks are selected to create an individual parity group. The disks should be identical in terms of disk type, speed, and capacity. Best practice 4, logical device (LDEV) creation Storage Advisor create LDEVs on parity groups that can be used as pool volumes for data protection pools. The API supports the following workflow for configuring parity groups: For each disk type (SSD, FMD, FMD DC2, and SAS): Get the disk and identify the total number of disks needed based on best practice 1. Calculate the number of hot spare disks needed based on best practice 1. Assign the host spare disks based on best practice 1. For every different speed for the chosen disk type: Determine the RAID type and layout based on best practice 2 or user input, if provided. Based on the layout, calculate the number of parity groups to be created and the size of each parity group for this disk type and speed. For each parity group to be created: Select the disk based on best practice 3. Create the parity group. Create LDEVs on the parity group based on best practice 4. Initialize and format LDEVs.
